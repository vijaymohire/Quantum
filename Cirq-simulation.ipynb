Before choosing a simulator, make sure it\n","supports the behavior that you need!\n","\n","| Project name | PyPI package | Description |\n","| --- | --- | --- |\n","| [qsim](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim) | qsimcirq | Implements `cirq.SimulatesAmplitudes` and `cirq.SimulatesFinalState`. Recommended for deep circuits with up to 30 qubits (consumes 8GB RAM). Larger circuits are possible, but RAM usage doubles with each additional qubit. |\n","| [qsimh](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim/blob/master/qsimcirq/qsimh_simulator.py) | qsimcirq | Implements `cirq.SimulatesAmplitudes`. Intended for heavy parallelization across several computers; Cirq users should generally prefer qsim. |\n","| [qFlex](https://github.com/ngnrsaa/qflex) | qflexcirq | Implements `cirq.SimulatesAmplitudes`. Recommended for shallow / low-entanglement circuits with more than 30 qubits. RAM usage is highly dependent on the number of two-qubit gates in the circuit. |\n","| [quimb](https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | quimb | Cirq-to-quimb translation layer provided in `contrib/quimb`. In addition to circuit simulation, this allows the use of quimb circuit-analysis tools on Cirq circuits. |\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SDstgYV1U2fV"},"source":["# Copyright 2020 The Cirq Developers \n","\n","This code is licensed under the Apache License, Version \n","2.0.
